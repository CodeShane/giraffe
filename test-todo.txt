FS/ES Implementation Tests
--------------------------

    Test methods exposed by FileSystem and FileSystemProvider and assume Files
    calls these methods properly

getPath()
    it parses relative paths
    it parses absolute paths
    it parses the empty path
    it normalizes trailing slashes
    it removes duplicated slashes
    it rejects invalid path characters

Path
    see ImmutableListPathCore test - do we need to duplicate all of this?
    parameterize by Path implementation / test path provider

Copying
    it copies between locations on a single remote
        with relative source and target
        with absolute source and target
        with large file
    it copies between remotes
        with relative source and target
        with absolute source and target
        with large file
    it respects appropriate CopyOptions
    it fails to copy non-empty directories

Create Directory
    it creates directory from relative path
    it creates directory from absolute path
    it does not create nested directories
    it fails if an existing file has the same name
    it sets appropriate file attributes
    it fails with non-provider paths

Delete
    it deletes files with relative paths
    it deletes files with absolute paths
    it fails to delete missing files
        deleteIfExits() does not fail

Moving
    if moves between locations on a single remote
        with relative source and target
        with absolute source and target
        with large files
    if moves between remotes
        with relative source and target
        with absolute source and target
        with large files
    it respects appropriate CopyOptions
    it failes to move non-empty directories
    it fails with non-provider paths

Reading
    it reads bytes from an InputStream
    it opens streams/channels for relative paths
    it opens streams/channels for absolute paths

Writing
    it writes bytes to an OutputStream
    it opens streams/channels for relative paths
    it opens streams/channels for absolute paths
    it respects appropriate OpenOptions
        it creates missing files

Utilities Tests
---------------

Files2
    recursiveDelete
        it deletes files
        it deletes single directories
        it deletes nested directories
    recursiveCopy
        it copies files
        it copies empty directories
        it copies single directories
        it copies nested directories

UniformPath
    see Path tests

FS/ES Performance Tests
-----------------------

Copying
    it copies 1MB, 10MB, 100MB files
    it copies 1000 small files

Writing
    it writes 1MB, 10MB, 100MB files
    it overwrites a file many times

Connections
    it connects 1000000 times (sequential, parallel)
